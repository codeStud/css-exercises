/* Start from the very beginning, i.e
- first make the top most parent (.header) as flex-container
- then given space between all the flex-items (justify-content: space-between)
NOTE THAT ONLY IMMEDIATE CHILDREN OF FLEX-CONTAINER BECOME FLEX ITEM (.logo, .links, .right-content)
- then make ul and .right-content as flex-containers => their direct children will become inline.
- then give some "gap" between the flex-items to separate them
- now, since you want to move 'ul' to the left side of the "main-axis" and there is NO PROPERTY as 
justify-items (to move SINGLE item along the main-axis) => ACHIEVE THIS USING 'margin'
- So, give 'ul' a margin-right: auto => ALL the blank space is eaten up by ul & it's shifted on left-side
- then to separate LOGO and ul, give some padding to ul (before that, do margin: 0, padding: 0 bcz 
ul items have some margin and padding already by default)

Also, learn to inspect the space taken by individual flex-items and blank spaces left.
Use broder: 2px solid blue (given to flex items) and chrome inspect tool to figure out the blank spaces)

IF YOUR justif-content isn't working => there's NO SPACE left for the items to take up.
